# spacegroup
This software program is to calculate diffraction pattern from nanoscale assembly. It can build a crystal model with various polyhedra. This program does not support molecular crystal model, and thus it does not include any cif file format related function. Once a model is ready, either 2D or 1D SAXS pattern can be calculated. Currently, only 1D powder diffraction may be open to use.
## Requirement
This is a program written in matlab, requiring to have a matlab license.
No additional matlab toolbox is needed.
## Installation
Download codes from the 'code' pulldown menu, for example as a zip. 

## How to start
1. Define the source and download folders as your matlab path. If not familiar with this, take a look at the direction from Mathworks. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html#:~:text=Change%20Folders%20on%20Search%20Path%20Interactively,-Use%20the%20Set&text=On%20the%20Home%20tab%2C%20in,folders%20to%20MATLAB%20search%20path.]

2. On matlab prompt >> spacegroup
3. You can load 'structure' and 'particle' model from the menu.

## Credits
All downloaded matlab codes are available in the download folder along with each licence disclaimer. 
The crystallographic space group is based on syminfo.lib from CCP4 and ccp4 space group c-codes[https://github.com/dials/ccp4io/tree/master/libccp4/ccp4] are translated into matlab by me. Use this at our own risk. Files whose names start with 'GSAS_' are translated from python codes available from GSAS website. [https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]
